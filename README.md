# Deutsche-Bank-Stock-Price-Prediction-Linear-Regression-vs-LSTM
An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts the next-day closing price of Deutsche Bank stock using historical market data. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering (lag features and moving averages), and model comparison between Linear Regression and LSTM to analyze performance and forecasting behavior
# 📌 Problem Statement

Financial time-series data are noisy, dynamic, and non-linear, making accurate stock price forecasting challenging.
The objective of this project is to:

Predict the next-day closing price of Deutsche Bank stock

Evaluate and compare the performance of Linear Regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks

Analyze how feature engineering and temporal modeling influence forecasting accuracy

# 🎯 Objectives

Build a reproducible data processing and modeling pipeline

Engineer time-dependent features to capture historical trends

Train and evaluate multiple predictive models

Identify strengths and limitations of classical ML vs deep learning

Propose a hybrid modeling direction
